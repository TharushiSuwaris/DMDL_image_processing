# DMDL_image_processing

This project addresses a three-class pose classification problem; sitting, standing, and walking/running, using RGB images. We experiment with multiple model types, including a baseline feedforward neural network (FNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), augmented CNN, a
MobileNetV2-based transfer learning model, and
multimodal embeddings from the CLIP model. The
goal is to evaluate performance differences across
models and datasets, specifically comparing original and background-removed images. We also explore the generalization capabilities of each model,
assess statistical significance, and analyze per-class
classification performance.
